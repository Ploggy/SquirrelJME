When I implement `SoftDouble`, depending on the source library I am basing
off if it uses `long` then I will use that for simplicity otherwise it will
be split via `int`. This way when I do major shifting around I do not need
to re-implement software `long` and instead just use it naturally as needed.
It will work just fine this way.
