I think I want to fork off the current SummerCoat stuff and then just delete
all of it from the branch to concentrate on SpringCoat only like I am currently
doing. There is a bunch of stuff that is not needed at all and I think a smaller
patch would be more beneficial. Of course nothing would be lost just shoved
into another branch.
