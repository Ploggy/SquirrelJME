Okay so I am thinking of starting a branch to implement non-UIForm based
drawing of widgets and otherwise since it will be needed by RatufaCoat and
it would be pretty useless without. At least as a base I could base it on
UIForms but have an additional property which checks if it is a canvas only
implementation in which case it will use the framebuffer drawing.
