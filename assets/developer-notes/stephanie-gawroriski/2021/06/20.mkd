The stack shuffling stuff is just wrong, so not even working correctly for
`DUP_X1`. Even forcing collisions gives the following which is very wrong.

```
R13 = List
R14 = int
OPS: [COPY(R14, R17), COPY(R13, R18), COPY(R17, R13),
                                           R14 int  
                                           COPY(R18, R14), COPY(R18, R15)]
                                                R13 list        R13 list
```
