So today rather than working on SummerCoat, I did lots of cherry picking and
plucked out all of the changes I did that were complete but not quite
related to SummerCoat. So this definitely lowers the risk of that branch.
At least now with it smaller, there is less weight on it. But I pulled out
lots of good changes, so I am very happy with it! Yipee!
