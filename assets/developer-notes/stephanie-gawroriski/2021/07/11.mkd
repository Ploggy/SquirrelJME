I think now that have `TableOfContents` it would be beneficial for the fields
and methods to also be structured with these. This will make it much more
easier to recycle basic data structures and make a bunch of code more common.
Of course that will simplify everything and the process of debugging. It is
eventually hoped that the stuff in `tool-classfile` will go away at some point
but no idea on that.
