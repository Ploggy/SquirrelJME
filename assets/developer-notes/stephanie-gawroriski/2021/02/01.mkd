Some thoughts on invoking interfaces: Interfaces will get a hashcode
associated with them. It will check the instance's interface table and try to
see if it can quickly get the desired interface:

```java
XTable xTable = i2xTable[target.className().hashCode() &
    (i2xTable.length - 1)];

if (xTable == COLLISION)
    xTable = linearScan(i2xTable, target);

invokeXTable(xTable, methodId, args);
```
