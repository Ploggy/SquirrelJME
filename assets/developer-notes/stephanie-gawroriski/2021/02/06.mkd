So I am getting `BC0u cc/squirreljme/runtime/cldc/io/Decoder`
`averageSequenceLength:()D`. So this is a method from a super-interface
and the Decoder is an interface itself. So I wonder.

Oh yes! Interfaces do not technically extend any other class other than `Object`
so I have to look at other classes in the interfaces!
