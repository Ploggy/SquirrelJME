I decided to take a break from SummerCoat and RatufaCoat I was working on
to write support for debugging. At least initially it will be SpringCoat as I
figure out the protocol and otherwise. But once it is fully working in
SpringCoat and works with IntelliJ I could very well bring it to SummerCoat.
At least with a debugger it will help with some more yuck parts of some
software.
