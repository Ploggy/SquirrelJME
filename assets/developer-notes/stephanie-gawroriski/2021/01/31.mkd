I made progress the other day getting a banner printed for SummerCoat, now today
is the launching of JARs. Also looks like for the super call to the constructor
in a constructor is doing a class check... that should probably be changed.

had luck with interfaces before the big refactorings, but now I do have an idea
of what I want to do with them and a nice way to handle it.
