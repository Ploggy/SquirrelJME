I think what would be useful for the compiler would be multiple output channels
for like debugging information and otherwise. Right now there is just data
output, but it would be useful to extract other potential information as needed.
This is just an example though. Std-err could be captured or maybe not captured.
Or maybe just instead, a decomposer of stuff. Maybe the AOT will have a debug
exploder of input so that whatever is generated can be spit back out.
